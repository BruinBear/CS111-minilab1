Response to Exercise 1:
I think in most cases ID can be passed back correct to the process that called the interrupt.
In cases where other processes was run by the schedule() call, since there is no isolation between processes, if other processes do something that change %eax information for the process that called SYS_GETPID, then the ID will be incorrect.


Anything else you'd like us to know:
#2 do_fork just need to find an available spot that can start a newprocess. . I basically just update stack pointer by id and move top bottom by the same amount of position. memcpy is used to copy information.

#3 added p_wait_id to specify any process that needs wating for the parent to continue. Added P_BLOCKED status to evade polling.

#4
Bug is that dead and not waiting processes are not set empty.
